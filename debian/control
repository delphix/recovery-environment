Description: Compact recovery environment for cloud VM debugging
  On modern cloud environments, it is often impossible to access a
  serial console to gain access to a machine that has becoem stuck in
  a boot loop. This can render a machine impossible to recover,
  resulting loss of data and time. This package allows you to create a
  simple recovery environment that provides a basic shell environment
  where you can do some debugging and attmpt to resolve the machine's
  problemms.
