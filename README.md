# Recovery Environment

This project implements a debian package that allows for the easy creation,
installation, and updating of a network-accessible recovery environment.

The overall structure of the project is simple, though not entirely
obvious. The stage1 script is the primary build script; it constructs the
recovery environment package, which can then be installed on any system with a
compatible architecture. The debian/postinst script functions as stage 2; it
runs when the package is installed on the target system, and copies
system-specific information into the recovery environment. Finally, there is
the recovery_sync script. This script is intended to be run by automation on
the target system whenever a significant configuration change occurs. The
script itself copies config data into the recovery environment so that it
remains accessible over the network.

The basics of the init system that the recovery environment uses are based on
the mkinitcpio project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes
on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* debhelper
* dropbear

Requires that systemd-networkd be in use for networking config, and requires a
ZFS boot/root pool. Also requires that the envblock feature be present in the
system's version of GRUB, and that the ZFS version be recent enough to use it.
